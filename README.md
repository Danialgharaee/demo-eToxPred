Drug development is becoming increasingly costly and time-consuming, with the efficiency of     launching new pharmaceuticals on the decline. To address this challenge, we offer a service  powered by eTox Pred, a cutting-edge machine learning tool designed to predict the toxicity and  synthetic accessibility of small organic compounds. Leveraging high-throughput experimental  techniques and computational modeling, eToxPred provides reliable assessments to streamline  drug discovery efforts.  
Our service utilizes eToxPred to evaluate drug candidates, ensuring you can filter out potentially toxic or hard-to-synthesize compounds early in the development process. With **72% accuracy in toxicity prediction** and a **4% mean square error for synthetic accessibility**, our service aims to reduce the time and costs involved in bringing new drugs to market.
